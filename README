Thinking Sphinx Excerpt Highlighting
=================================

This plugin extends Thinking Sphinx to do excerpt highlighting. That means you can present search results and have the words around the search terms excerpted with the search term highlighted.




Example
=======

Post.search "garden", :excerpts => true

By default the search terms are highlighted with <strong> tags. If you want a different tag, specify it as follows in a config/initializer:

ThinkingSphinx::Search.wraptag = "em"

You don't really have a choice about having the search terms highlighted. If you want a tag that is unstyled by default, use this:

ThinkingSphinx::Search.wraptag = ""

Then the wrapping tag will be "<span class='match'>", which you can safely ignore.


Pagination
==========

Thinking Sphinx has gone more aggressively in the direction of forcing you to use Will Paginate. However, if you have paginating_find available, then this plugin will transform the results into a PagingEnumerator regardless of whether you perform excerpting. If you have paginating_find but for some reason would rather use will_paginate:

ThinkingSphinx::Search.configure_excerpts :paginating_find => false

In either scenario, the following would yield the second page of Davids:
User.search "David", :excerpts => true, :page => 2
